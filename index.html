      <h2>Maserati's timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Alfieri, Ettore and Ernesto Maserati open the “Società Anonima Officine Alfieri Maserati”, a car workshop at 1, via de’Pepoli in Bologna. Five months later Italy is at war and the brothers’ technical ingenuity is put to the test.</li>
        <li><strong>1926</strong> - During the winter months, the Maserati Brothers worked tirelessly on their first original creation: the Tipo 26. It’s the first car named Maserati and it’s proudly displaying the soon-to-be-famous Trident logo.</li>
        <li><strong>1937</strong> - Adolfo Orsi, an entrepreneur from Modena, purchases Maserati from the Maserati brothers.</li>
        <li><strong>1939</strong> - Maserati officially moves from Bologna to Modena.</li>
        <li><strong>1947</strong> - The A6 1500 model is presented at the Geneva Motor Show. Designed by Pininfarina, the car is named after Alfieri and the number of cylinders. It’s the first Maserati destined for daily use rather than racing, and is a huge success.</li>
        <li><strong>1957</strong> - The 3500 GT model is presented at the Geneva Motor Show and production levels scale up to meet an increasing demand for grand tourers.</li>
        <li><strong>1963</strong> - The first Quattroporte is presented at the Turin Motor Show, introducing a whole new category to the marketplace: the luxury sports sedan.</li>
        <li><strong>1966</strong> - The first Ghibli, designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, is presented at the Turin Motor Show.</li>
        <li><strong>1968</strong> - Maserati was taken over by French car-maker Citroën, and Orsi remained the nominal president.</li>
        <li><strong>1971</strong> - The Maserati Bora, another of Giugiaro’s masterpieces, is presented at the Geneva Motor Show. Adolfo Maserati and his son Omar feel they are out of place in the new Maserati, and they step down.</li>
        <li><strong>1975</strong> - The ownership of Maserati passed from Citroën to Italian state-owned holding company GEPI and Alejandro de Tomaso, an Argentinian industrialist and former racing driver, who then became the company's president and CEO.</li>
        <li><strong>1980</strong> - The Biturbo model was introduced with a twin-turbocharged V6 engine, the first ever in a production car.</li>
        <li><strong>1989</strong> - In October, GEPI sold its share to De Tomaso. In December, Fiat bought a 49% share in Maserati.</li>
        <li><strong>1993</strong> - De Tomaso sold its 51% stake in Maserati to Fiat, which became the sole owner.</li>
        <li><strong>1997</strong> - Fiat sold a 50% share in the company to Maserati's long-time arch-rival Ferrari (Ferrari itself being owned by Fiat). Two years later, Ferrari took full control, making Maserati its luxury division.</li>
        <li><strong>2003</strong> - At the Frankfurt Motor Show, the 5th generation of Quattroporte is unveiled. It is the first Maserati designed by Pininfarina in 50 years.</li>
        <li><strong>2007</strong> - The GranTurismo model is introduced at the Geneva Motor Show.</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong> - The Detroit Motor Show is the setting for the worldwide introduction of the 6th generation Quattroporte, while the Ghibli, a re-envisioned and wildly successful mid-sized sedan, is presented at the Shanghai Motor Show.</li>
        <li><strong>2014</strong> - Maserati presents its concept car Alfieri at the Geneva Motor Show and celebrates its Centennial Anniversary.</li>
        <li><strong>2017</strong> - The Levante model, the Maserati of SUVs, is launched at the Geneva Motor Show and the restyled GranTurismo and GranCabrio models are presented at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.</li>
